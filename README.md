# MathTrainer ![](mathtrainer_logo.jpg)

### Welcome! :smile:

This is my first official project release. This project is about maths and how to put it into a game. I always find it **SO** boring to do math problems for no reason; and that made me think of this project in the first place! Keep in mind that since this is the first release, it will have really basic graphics.  

### Improvements :computer:
  
##### Developers
You are more than welcomed to fork this repository and add in your own changes if you want. But keep in mind that if your feature/request requires some extra package that is not downloadable using the command `pip install`, you need to commit it along with to the repository.  

##### Non-Developers
You can send a message to my github account and request your change. But before you start complaining about everything, keep in mind that this whole project is made by a 12 year old boy **(NO LIES)**.  

 > NOTE: This file will be updated with each release
